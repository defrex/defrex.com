# Real Free Will

The topic of free will is often fraught with ill-defined terms. The question "what is free will?" is often neglected in favour of the question "do we have free will?". This leads the conversation into mystical places, where free will stands in oposition to material reality. This is because pure materialism implies that causes lead to effects in a nesscisary and unbroken chain that leaves no room for something presumably non-physical like free will.

It's the presumed non-physicality of free will that I intend to challenge in this article. Free will can be perfectly compatible with a deterministic physical reality.

### What is Free Will?

So then, let us start with a definition. 

> Free will is the ability of an _agent_ to take an _action_ over some _degree of freedom_.

Each of these terms, "agent", "action", and "degree of freedom" will require unpacking. We shall try to find a satisfying realist definition for each.

### The Ship of Theseus

There is a classic thought experiment from Plato. If Theseus has a ship, which takes damage and is repaired from time to time, eventually replacing every part of the ship, at what point is it a new ship? Of course, the question applies equally well you humans, who completely replace their cells multiple times throughout their lives.

The question is important because, if we're going to define an agent physically, so to must we define Theseus's fabled ship.

To get at an answer, we must consider not only the ship's extent in space, but also it's extent in time. Take the following timeline.

1. The ship is at the dock
2. The ship is at sea
3. The ship is damaged at sea
4. The ship is damaged at the dock
5. The ship is repaired at the dock
6. The ship is at the dock

Now, when we observe the ship at each time, how much of the ship do we observe? At t1 and t2, it would seem to be 100% the Ship of Theseus. Just moving it from the dock to the water doesn't alter it's identity. At t3, the ship is damaged. Perhaps now it's 85% this ship it used to be. Noticably changed, but still basically the same ship. No change from t4 to t5. Then at t6, the ship is restored to 100% Ship of Theseus. 

But wait, you may say, doesn't it end up being 85% Ship of Theseus and 15% some new ship? No, because the Ship of Theseus is _information_, and the information was restored.

Information is merely a quantity for communication. So the ship is information is the sense that, when observed, it communicates the idea "Ship of Theseus". The idea "Ship of Theseus" is a fairly complex one, meaning the information can only be decoded by relatively smart animals. Information isn't reserved for smart animals, however. A river flowing through a landscape communicates with everything it touches. It sends information with time-wise contenuity, despire being new water moment to moment. The nearby rocks receive the information and are shaped by it.

Identity comes from contenuity of information over time. t1 and t6 are the same ship because they communicate the same information.

This sort of informational identity gives us our definition for _agent_. Whether a ship, a river, or a human, our agent must have identity. 

### Within You or Without You

With identity defined above, we can now say what is internal, vs external, to our agent.

Things with identity are communicating across some horizon. A lot may be happing internally that isn't communicated. Some of it may be irrelevant to the items idenity and some of it may be aggregated into the identity. I can see and touch Theseus's ship, perhaps test it's bouyancy or other properties, but there are many details (the molucular structure, for example) that can't be precieved directly and are internal to the ship.

Within and without being defined is critical for our agent, as we shall see.

### How to Act

Given all this, what is an action? An action occurs when a stimulous from without you leads you to alter the information you emit.

----

(We could definite this mathematically using Bayes, but it's not necessary for this argument.)

Identity comes from time-wise continuity of information.

The Ship of Theseus is _information_. Information is merely a quantity for communication.
so the ship is information is the sense that, when observed, it communicates the idea "Ship of Theseus".
